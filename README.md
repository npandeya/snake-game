# Snake Game
This readme is created by my readme skill with my universal AI Agent.
## Overview

Welcome to the Snake Game project! This is a classic implementation of the popular Snake game using modern web technologies. Players control a snake to eat food and grow while avoiding collisions with the walls and themselves. This project is designed to be easily deployable using Docker and Kubernetes, providing a robust architecture for running the game in different environments.

## Detailed File Descriptions

### Main Application Directory

#### `app/`

- **index.html**: 
  This is the entry point for the Snake Game. The HTML file structures the user interface and loads the necessary CSS and JavaScript files. It includes game instructions and sets up the canvas where the game takes place.

- **package.json**: 
  This file defines the project dependencies, scripts, and metadata required for Node.js. It lists all the libraries the application needs (like those for testing, development tools, etc.), making it easier to manage and install these packages using npm.

- **snake-test.js**: 
  Contains unit tests for the Snake game's functionality. It aims to verify that the game's logic works correctly by testing various scenarios (e.g., snake movement, collision detection). This is crucial for maintaining code quality as the project evolves.

- **snake.js**: 
  This file houses the primary game logic. It contains functions to control the snake's movement, manage game state, handle user inputs, and check for collisions with the walls or food. It is the core of the game's mechanics.

- **style.css**: 
  CSS file that determines the game's visual presentation. It styles the game elements such as the snake, food, and playing area to create an engaging and user-friendly interface.

- **webpack.config.js**: 
  This configuration file is crucial for using Webpack, a static module bundler for JavaScript applications. It specifies how the application's assets are processed and bundled together, including JavaScript transpilation, CSS preprocessing, and image optimization.

### Kubernetes Configuration

#### `k8s/`

- **deployment.yaml**: 
  This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Deployment for the Snake Game application. It specifies the desired state of the application, including the Docker image to use, the number of replicas, and update strategies. This resource manages the application's lifecycle on the Kubernetes cluster.

- **ingress.yaml**: 
  This file sets up an Ingress resource for handling HTTP requests. It defines routing rules to direct external traffic coming into the cluster to the correct service, allowing users to access the Snake Game via web browsers.

- **service.yaml**: 
  This file creates a Kubernetes Service that exposes the Snake Game application to external traffic. It facilitates communication between the application pods and allows the game to be reachable over a network.

### Template Files

#### `k8s_template/`

- **deployment.tpl**: 
  A template used to define Kubernetes deployments in a reusable manner. This file allows for parameterized configurations that can be modified easily, providing flexibility in deployment scenarios.

### SonarQube Configuration

- **sonar-instructions.md**: 
  This Markdown file provides instructions for integrating SonarQube with the repository. It includes steps for setting up code quality checks, ensuring that the code adheres to best practices and standards as part of the continuous integration process.

- **sonar-project.properties**: 
  A configuration file for SonarQube, specifying which files and directories should be analyzed. It sets parameters for the quality checks, enabling automated code reviews and assessments.

## Installation

To get started with the Snake Game project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
